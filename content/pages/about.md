Hey there!

Welcome to my site. I'm a full-stack software engineer based in Boston, MA.  I currently work for Postscript, building a first in class sms marketing platform for e-commerce. I've worked in many stacks but am currently building with Flask/Python and React. While I am primarily an engineer, I've also dabbled in UX, product, and management.

Outside of work you'll probably find me outside.  I'm an avid snowboarder, hiker, and soccer player/fan; also getting my feet wet with rock climbing.  I also love music, cooking, and travel.

Drop me a line if you ever want to talk software, startups, snowboarding, or the English Premier League (unless you're an Arsenal fan ðŸ˜‰). Cheers!
