I started my first all-remote job in January of 2020. While I enjoyed working from home in jobs past, working with an entirely distributed team was uncharted terrain for me. I was a little worried about the usual remote work hangups before accepting the job: comradery, communcation, and timezones to name a few.  But the perks heavily outweighed any risks and the decision was a no brainer.  To start, as an engineer, I find office spaces to be immensly distracting. Getting into a focus state and performing deep work was  difficult for me in an open office. I also disliked the feeling of being bound to a physical location.  I'm a big traveler and wanted the flexibility to work anywhere.  None of these upsides are novel. However they were particularly attractive to me and addressed real pain points I had with traditional workplaces.

Now, being 6 months into remote work, I've gotten to experience the realities of this new style of working. Here are a few tips I have to help you get the most out of your remote working experience.

### Invest in your Workspace

This might be an obvious one, but investing in an ergomnomic workspace can be a critical component to your productivity. If you're lucky your company will provide you a stipend to bootstrap your workspace (thanks Postscript).  Beyond the desk itself, make sure you have the following:

* A Solid Monitor with a riser
* Comfortable Chair
* Ergonomic Mouse (Sorry Magic Mouse)
* External Keyboard
* Laptop Stand/dock

Since you'll be spending a lot of time at your desk, this investment will be well worth it. Your back will thank you.

### Over Communicate

Things get lost in communication in traditional workplaces.  This is only amplified in remote workplaces.  Conversations at my company happen primarily through slack, in async fashion. Oftentimes these conversations happen in private threads and aren't surfaced to the team unless explicit action is taken to do so.  Thus it is important to air on the side of overcommunication to ensure your team is in sync.  Otherwise important details in conversations get lost and your team can get left out of the loop.


### Create Boundries

Many workers in traditional settings benefit from the physical separation of work and home.  Once they leave work they are "turned off" for the evening and can focus on family, relaxation and hobbies. With the physical separation of the two spaces removed, this can be quite difficult.  You'll be tempted to be online a little later/earlier than usual when your team is based in different timezones.  To combat this I recommend creating hard cut off hours and sticking to them.  For me this is normally 6pm eastern.  My cut off time might be a bit earlier if I'm planning on doing some deep work at night, once slack has quieted down.

## In Summary

Remote work is the future no doubt.  While there are many pros to remote work, conscious effort should be taken to get the most out of the experience.
